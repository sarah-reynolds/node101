	<h1>Races of Skyrim</h1>
	<h2>Argonian</h2>
	<p>Little is known and less is understood about the reptilian denizens of Black Marsh. Years of defending their borders have made the Argonians experts in guerrilla warfare, and their natural abilities make them equally at home in water and on land. They are well-suited for the treacherous swamps of their homeland, and have developed natural immunities to the diseases and poisons that have doomed many would-be explorers into the region. Argonians are creatures that can come and walk around on land but they are mainly made to be a water creature which can easily be told by their water breathing ability.</p>
